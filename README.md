# X Status (Date and Time of Posting)

## About

A Python script, made with Tweepy, to retrieve the date and time of when a status on X was posted.

NOTE: The `created_at` attribute of the Status object provides a datetime object, which outputs when the status was posted.

## Instructions for Usage

Firstly, replace "ENTER ID HERE" (line 14) with the ID of the Twitter status. Then, download the code.

CLI:

- Run `python3 XStatusDateTime.py` in a terminal if you have MacOS/Linux.
- Run `python XStatusDateTime.py` in a terminal if you have Windows.
